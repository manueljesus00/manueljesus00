# Manuel Jesus - @manueljesus00
Hello world! I'm Manuel Jesus *(aka emanuell)* and I'm currently a computer science student at the Pablo de Olavide University in Seville but previously I have studied 4 years that are divided into two of Higher Technician in Computer Network Systems Management and other two of Technician in Microcomputer Systems and Networks.

## About me and my personality
I consider myself a geek person from both Mr Robot, La Casa de Papel and, at the book level, authors such as Suzanne Collins or Dan Brown among others. One of my hobbies is photography but I also like to learn and I am in a process of studying computer security, especially the field of social engineering.
